There are various versions of GANS that
can be used to get desired results like 
there are Comditional Gans , Attention Gans
etc.  etc 
So In conditional Gans we can specify how 
the generated inages should like like. 
The input which is fed to the generator 
can be conitioned with the required
attributes that we want in the image.
and the genearted image has those attributes 
in it..............................
So, how does basic text-to-image generation
using Gans work..The generator and the
discriminator networks are basically deep 
convolutional neural networks which works
adversarially.The text description is 
encoded and sent as input to the generator.
The generator then produces an image as output
this image and the description is provided
as input to the discriminator and the 
discriminator then checks whether the 
image matches with the descriptions or not
And upon various iterations,the generator
becomes able to produce images exactly as given 
in the descriptons.
